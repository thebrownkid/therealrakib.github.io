    <h3>Declining Home Ownership Affordability in the United States</h3>

    <p>Being able to buy a home is one of the biggest aspirations for most people in the United States. In fact, according to a survey conducted by NerdWallet, “an overwhelming majority of Americans (91%) would like to own at least one home in their lifetime”.</p>
    <p>However, concerns have been rising for a good number of years now about the decreasing affordability of the market compared to income growth.</p>
    <p> Personally, I have also come across this concern 
    <p>Having worked as a strategy consultant for political campaigns, I have come across several constituent surveys where homeownership affordability was a common issue.</p>
    <p>That and my personal interest in homeownership created a natural curiosity to see how affordability has changed.</p>
    
    <h5>Income vs Down Payment</h5>
    <p>One of the most fundamental methodologies to track homeownership affordability is to see how household income has changed relative to home prices.</p>
    <p>However, the home sales price is a much higher number when compared to income. Additionally, most home buyers traditionally use a loan instead of buying outright. Hence, the better comparison would be between the median annual income and the median down payment (calculates as 20% of the home sales price – the standardized down payment percentage used by lenders and realtors).</p>
