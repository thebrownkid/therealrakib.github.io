    <p>This is a graph of Median Annual Household Income in the United States over time from 1990 to 2021.</p>
    <p>However, besides income, an important issue to track is average consumer expenditure. The difference between the two (income - expenditure) shows how much the median person has leftover.</p>
    <p>The size of each circle is determined by that difference of income - expenditure (larger circles signifying a higher difference and vice versa).</p>
    <p>Finally to see the data through another dimension, we use the color red and blue to indicate whether the difference of income - expenditure is negative (income deficit) or positive (income surplus).</p>
